# Computer Graphics Project

## Description
This project is a simple 3D scene renderer in Java. It allows the user to create and interact with lights, cubes, spheres, pyramids, and a camera using Ray and Vec3 classes. Scenes are fully customizable to the programmer's desire.

## Features
- Add and animate cubes, spheres, and pyramids
- Camera movement and scene navigation with key listeners
- Dynamic lighting
- Continuous animation loop for scene objects

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Animating the scene:** Initially tried using a `for` loop, but switching to a `while` loop allowed smooth, continuous animation.
- **Camera interaction:** Implemented key listeners to move the camera and interact with the scene in real time.

## How to Run
1. Open the project in your Java IDE.
2. Run the `Main` class to start the JFrame and scene.
3. Use arrow keys or WASD for camera movement and interact with lights as desired.
